# patatap-lofi-clone

A low-fi clone of the website [www.patatap.com](https://patatap.com/) used as an exercise to practice the core concepts
of Webpack, VanillaJS and audio/media skills.

## Requirements
* `Yarn +1.19.x`.

## Setup
Start by running `yarn install` to install project dependencies. These dependencies are locked with the tilde `~` symbol
to only apply bugfix updates and ensure a proper resemblance of the dependency tree to that in which I have develop the
app.

## About
This project uses `Webpack` as a module bundler, `Yarn` as a package manager, `Babel` as code transpiler, `eslint`
as code styler and linter.

## Start development server
You can have a development server started with the command `yarn start`.

## Requirements
* Yarn

## Setup
Start by running `yarn install` to install project dependencies. These dependencies are locked with the tilde `~` symbol
to only apply bugfix updates and ensure a proper resemblance of the dependency tree to that in which I have develop the
app.

## Start development server
You can have a development server started with the command `yarn start`
